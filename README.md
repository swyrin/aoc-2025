# Advent of Code 2025

My template and submissions for Advent of Code 2025.

## Rules

> Following it is optional.

- Rust only.

- No `unsafe` code, at all costs.

## Is there any preconfigured workspace?

- The template code can be found at `src/bin/day_0/main.rs`

- With VSCode as the preferred editor. [That is what the Rust team recommends anyway](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/book/vs_code.html#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20best%20supported%20editor%20at%20the%20moment.).
